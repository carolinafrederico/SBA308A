**# News From Around The World - API News App**

## Overview

My fourth Skill-Based Assessment (SBA 308A) project is focused on building a JavaScript Web Application. This assessment aims to demonstrate proficiency in implementing advanced JavaScript tools and features in a practical manner.

As a journalist, I chose to create a news aggregator site that fetches real-time news articles from various sources. The site allows users to search and explore news based on topics, locations, and trending events.

## Features

* Fetches live news articles from the News API.

* Users can search for news by keywords, locations, or names.

* Responsive design for an optimized experience on all devices.

* Clean and structured UI with dynamic elements.

* Read More functionality for full articles.

## Technologies Used

* HTML - Structuring the web pages.

* CSS - Styling the UI with a modern and professional look.

* JavaScript - Handling API requests, DOM manipulation, and interactivity.

* News API - Fetching real-time news content.

## Installation & Setup

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/news-api-app.git
cd news-api-app

Open index.html in your browser or use a local server.

Obtain an API key from NewsAPI and replace apiKey in script.js.

Enjoy browsing the latest news!

## Usage

* Enter a keyword in the search bar and click Search.

* Click on a news article to open the full story in a new tab.

* Browse through automatically fetched trending articles.

## Future Improvements

* Implement pagination for more search results.

* Displays trending news in a sidebar.

* Add category-based filtering (e.g., politics, sports, technology).

* Include user preferences and saved articles feature.

* Secure API calls by routing them through a backend server.
